migrate:
Migrations are how Django stores changes to your models (and thus your database schema) - 
they¡¯re just files on disk. You can read the migration for your new model if you like; 
it¡¯s the file polls/migrations/0001_initial.py. Don¡¯t worry, you¡¯re not expected to read
them every time Django makes one, but they¡¯re designed to be human-editable in case you 
want to manually tweak how Django changes things.

makemigrate:
By running makemigrations, you¡¯re telling Django that you¡¯ve made some changes to your models 
(in this case, you¡¯ve made new ones) and that you¡¯d like the changes to be stored as a migration.

Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes
Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.
